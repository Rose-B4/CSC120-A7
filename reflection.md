- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
In cafe
    sellCoffee can now take just a size if the customer doesn't want any cream or sugar
    cafe constructor can now be used without passing in any quantities for inventory so a cafe can be built with an empty stock
In House
    moveOut can now take a list of names to move out multiple people at once
    moveIn can now take a list of names to move in multiple people at once
In Library
    isAvailable can now take no parameters to display all available titles
    returnBook can now take a list of titles to return multiple books at once

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    It was kind of difficult to come up with multiple ideas for methods to overload, most of them just ended up being, pass in a list so the user can do multiple things at once
